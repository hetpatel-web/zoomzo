# Zoomzo

Zoomzo is a fun used car deal finder bot. The project is split into a Python backend
for scraping, filtering, and notifications, and a Next.js frontend for displaying
results.

## Structure

- `backend/` – Handles scraping, filtering, scheduling, and notifications.
- `frontend/` – User interface built with Next.js to show filtered listings.

This repository currently contains only a scaffold; implementation will be added later.
